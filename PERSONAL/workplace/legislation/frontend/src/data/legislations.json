It also includes foreign sellers who deliver packaged products directly to Dutch consumers through distance sales.

        "summary": "The PPWR is designed to modernize and harmonize packaging regulations, thereby reducing environmental impact, fostering a circular economy, and enhancing the internal market's efficiency. The PPWR establishes ambitious goals, such as preventing the generation of packaging waste, ensuring all EU market packaging is recyclable by 2030, increasing recycled plastics in packaging to replace virgin materials, and mandating deposit return systems for plastic bottles and aluminum cans. It introduces stringent measures for packaging design, reuse, recycling, and labelling, alongside reporting obligations. Additionally, the PPWR aims to prevent waste generation, reduce packaging volumes, and promote reuse and refill systems. It also focuses on preventing excessive packaging, encouraging green public procurement, and standardizing labelling for correct disposal.",
        "scope": "The proposed PPWR applies a broad definition of packaging. A limited number of exemptions apply, but in principle packaging is defined as items of any materials that are intended to be used for the containment, protection, handling, delivery or presentation of products. \n\nThe PPWR applies to any economic operator who makes packaging available on the market within the territory of a Member State, whether as self-standing packaging or as the packaging for a product. Such an operator is considered the producer of the packaging and, among others, has to meet the extended producer responsibility obligations for the packaging waste management. The PPWR also applies to manufacturers of packaging, as well as importers or distributors who place packaging on the market under their own name or trademark or modify packaging already placed on the market in a way that may affect its compliance with the PPWR.",
        "responsible_party": "The PPWR applies to various parties that are involved in the supply chain of packaging and packaged products on the EU market. These parties are defined as economic operators and include manufacturers, suppliers, importers, distributors, authorised representatives, final distributors, and fulfilment service providers of packaging or packaged products. \n\nThe PPWR defines producers as manufacturers, importers, or distributors who make packaging available for the first time on the market of a Member State. This applies irrespective of the selling method and therefore includes distance sales. When a producer is not established in the relevant Member State they can be obligated to appoint an authorised representative to fulfil their obligations on their behalf. \n\nFinally, the PPWR also applies to online platforms that allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with producers. These online platforms must collect information from the producers before allowing them to conclude sales via their platform.",

The Waste Ordinance contains several different rules on the handling of waste for those who are operators, e.g. permit and notification obligation for professional transport of waste as well as obligation to provide information on waste and waste management.\n\nThe ordinance establishes criteria and procedures for classifying different types of waste, including hazardous waste, household waste, industrial waste, and construction and demolition waste. When waste is to be classified, the waste holder must determine the six-digit waste code in Appendix 3 that best describes the waste. Proper classification is essential for determining appropriate handling, treatment, and disposal methods. Municipalities, companies and businesses must report recorded data on hazardous waste to a electronic waste register at the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency.",
        "scope": "If hazardous waste occurs in your business, you are a waste producer. All operations in which it arises or which handle hazardous waste are covered by the requirement to keep notes on the hazardous waste and report to the waste register. There are no lower limits regarding, for example, the amount of waste or the size of the business.\n\nObligation to make notes comes into force on 08/01/2020 and affects all businesses that produce, transport, collect, treat and broker or trade in hazardous waste. Approximately 1 million companies and businesses are affected - regardless of what business is being conducted, almost everyone leaves behind some form of hazardous waste, e.g. electronics, fluorescent tubes and various chemicals.",
        "responsible_party": "Municipalities: Municipalities in Sweden are responsible for waste management within their respective territories. Waste Management Companies: Companies and organizations involved in waste collection, transportation, treatment, and disposal. Producers and Importers: Producers and importers of products that generate waste, such as packaging, electronics, and batteries. Industrial and Commercial Entities: Businesses, industries, and commercial establishments that generate waste as part of their operations must comply with the Waste Ordinance's requirements for waste management and disposal. Waste Treatment Facilities: Facilities involved in waste treatment, recycling, composting, incineration, and landfilling must adhere to the regulations and standards specified in the Waste Ordinance. Individuals: While individuals are not directly regulated by the Waste Ordinance, they have a responsibility to dispose of waste properly and participate in waste separation and recycling programs.",

This includes all forms of plastic packaging, whether it is used for wrapping, containing, or protecting goods.\n\n2. Importing Plastic Packaging:\n   - Businesses that import plastic packaging into the UK, whether it is empty or filled with goods, must report this activity if the 10-tonne threshold is met. The reporting obligation applies to all types of imported plastic packaging, including single-use and reusable items.\n\n3. Meeting the 10-Tonne Threshold:\n   - The primary trigger for reporting is meeting or exceeding the threshold of manufacturing or importing 10 tonnes of plastic packaging within any 12-month period. Businesses must monitor their production and import volumes continuously to determine if they cross this threshold. This threshold will mean an entity needs to both register for PPT and start submitting reports.\n\n4. Plastic Packaging with Less than 30% Recycled Content:\n   - If the plastic packaging manufactured or imported contains less than 30% recycled plastic, it is subject to the tax, and detailed reporting is required. This involves providing data on the total weight of the packaging and the recycled content percentage.\n\n5. Changing Circumstances:\n   - If a business initially does not meet the threshold but later exceeds it within the 12-month period, it must register and start reporting from that point forward. Similarly, businesses that previously met the threshold but fall below it should continue monitoring their activities to ensure compliance if they re-exceed the threshold.\n\n6. Exemptions and Special Cases:\n   - Even if some plastic packaging is exempt (e.g., for medicinal products or exports), businesses must report the total quantities and specify exempt amounts to HMRC. Detailed records supporting these exemptions must be maintained. These items are exempt from the tax but must still be reported and still count towards the 10 tonnes registration threshold.",

The tax was Introduced by the UK government to ultimately reduce the volume of plastic packaging waste which ends up in UK landfill.",
        "scope": "UK PPT applies to packaging components that are imported into or manufactured/finished in the UK  and contain less than 30% recycled plastic.\n\nA ‘packaging component’ is a product that is designed to be suitable for use, whether alone or in combination with other products, in the containment, protection, handling, delivery or presentation of goods at any stage in the supply chain of the goods. This definition is broad and includes items which may not conventionally be understood to be “packaging”, such as coat hangers and labels.\n\nA packaging component is chargeable if the proportion of recycled plastic in the component, when measured by weight, is less than 30% of the total amount of plastic in the component, and it is considered 'finished'.",
        "responsible_party": "Businesses must register for UK Plastic Packaging Tax if they:\n\n- expect to import into the UK or manufacture in the UK 10 tonnes or more of finished plastic packaging components in the next 30 days; or\n- have imported into the UK or manufactured in the UK 10 tonnes or more of finished plastic packaging components in the last 12 months.\n\nBusinesses will need to pay Plastic Packaging Tax if they have manufactured or imported plastic packaging components which contain less than 30% recycled plastic.",
