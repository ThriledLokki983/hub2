In addition, the above words have the meaning described in this Privacy Statement.<p/><p>This Privacy Statement applicable to following PwC website(s):<p/><p>Nothing here yet.</p><br/><h6>Our international network:</h6><p>The PwC network is a worldwide network of independent member firms that operate locally in countries throughout the world. PwC NL, as each member firm in the PwC network, is a separate legal entity and a separate controller for personal data. For further details, please see https://www.pwc.nl/en/onze-organisatie.html.</p><p>We would like to note that the international and regional or practice-related websites that fall within PwC.com are provided by other entities within the PwC network and not by PwC NL. This Privacy Statement does not apply to these websites or to other websites that may be linked to this website. We recommend that visitors carefully read the privacy statements of each of these other websites before they provide any personal data.</p><p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable living person. When “you” or “your” is used in this Statement, we are referring to the relevant individual who is the subject of the personal data. PwC NL processes personal data for numerous purposes, and the means of collection, lawful basis of processing, use, disclosure, and retention periods for each purpose may differ. We do not store your personal data for longer than necessary for the purposes for which we process your personal data, unless we are required to retain your personal data for longer under applicable laws and regulations.</p><p>When collecting and using personal data, our policy is to be transparent about why and how we process personal data. To find out more about our specific processing activities, please go to the relevant sections of this Statement.</p><br/><h6>Use of Personal Data</h6><p><div style='padding-left: 35px; border-left: 1px solid darkgray'>Nothing here yet.</div></p><br/><br/><p><h2>2. Security</h2></p><p>We take the protection of all data we hold very seriously. That is why we have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures to guarantee a risk-adjusted security level. We adhere to internationally recognised security standards and our information security management system relating to client confidential data is independently certified as complying with the requirements of ISO/IEC 27001:2013. We have a framework of policies, procedures and training in place covering data protection, confidentiality and security and regularly review the appropriateness of the measures we have in place to keep the data we hold secure.</p><h2>3. When and how we share personal data</h3><p>We will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so. When we share data with others, we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place as appropriate to protect the data and to comply with our data protection, confidentiality and security standards.</p><p>We are part of a global network of member firms and, as well as other professional service providers, we use third parties located in other countries to help us run our business. As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the countries where we and our clients are located. This includes to countries outside the European Union and to countries that do not have laws that provide specific protection for personal data. We have taken steps to ensure all personal data is provided with adequate protection and that all transfers of personal data outside the EU are done lawfully. Where we transfer personal data outside of the EU to a country not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, the transfers will be under an agreement which covers the EU requirements for the transfer of personal data outside the EU, such as by the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses.</p><h2>4.Personal data held by us may be transferred to:</h2><h6>Other PwC-member firms</h6><ul><li>For details of our PwC-member firm locations, please click <a href='https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/about/office-locations.html'>here</a>.</li><li>PwC NL may share personal data with other PwC-member firms where necessary for administrative purposes and to provide professional services to our clients (e.g. when providing services involving advice from PwC-member firms in different territories).</li><li>PwC NL stores personal data on our or other PwC-member firm servers.
