This updated version of the Basel IV text was the basis of this requirements document. The requirements that are embedded in the formal proposal of the CRR III are based on the regulations stated in the BCBS publication of April 2019 (hereafter Basel IV).1   The European Committee disclosed the formal proposal of the CRR III and CRD VI, including the Basel IV implementation in European law in October 2021. In this proposal some differences compared to Basel IV are introduced. Therefore, this document will reference the CRR III articles together with the Basel IV Requirements. When Basel IV and CRR III differ, CRR III is leading. Under CRR III there are two broad methodologies for calculating their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first, the Standardised Approach (SA), assigns standardised risk weights to exposures. The second approach, which is subject to supervisory approval, is the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) in which the risk weights are calculated based on (internal) estimates of PD, LGD and EAD. Even when the IRB approach is used, the SA risk weights need to be calculated and used in the output floor that applies to all exposures. This document condenses the requirements set in the draft Capital Requirements Regulations (CRR) III applicable to retail exposures under the standardised approach to a document usable for its implementation.   1.1. Governance Bank X has a review and approval process governance in place for the development of models. Since the regulatory requirements for Basel IV are not considered a model2, this process is not applicable. In order to guarantee sufficient reviews and involvement of the most relevant stakeholders the Basel IV requirement team Credit Risk designed a Basel IV specific governance process for the requirement packages.      1Basel IV is an international regulatory framework for banks, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). 2 Decision", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35bb11ca-149c-483e-bb7c-fc3206bdc2c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "35bb11ca-149c-483e-bb7c-fc3206bdc2c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/gnimoh001/projects/STUDY/2024/GUI-CHALLENGES/ai/ai-lab/RAG/code/docs/ist_docs/Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384994, "creation_date": "2024-05-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-05-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6a879b9f-2aad-4df3-a607-ac59e1c7001f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/gnimoh001/projects/STUDY/2024/GUI-CHALLENGES/ai/ai-lab/RAG/code/docs/ist_docs/Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384994, "creation_date": "2024-05-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-05-07"}, "hash": "ca4a1e489a4fd7d37a87ecc4f32fca53fb161d1c88df78bdd03b89144323e273", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "1.2.

Credit exposure Credit exposure is defined in the Global Standard CRP3; there is no impact of the new CRR III Article 5 (5) definition.4 Credit exposure means that a claim results or could result from a legally binding credit agreement. This agreement means a contract or otherwise written agreement under which Bank X (as part of ordinary banking operations) has a claim or could obtain a claim on an Obligor by providing any product or service. This includes but is not limited to loans, overdraft Facilities, derivatives, bank guarantees, letters of credit and treasury services.

The exposure amount is calculated in the following manner: OnbalanceAmount (as defined in footnote 6) + (OffbalanceAmount * CCF), where CCF is based on the values as prescribed by the standardised approach.

Introduction This section details the general and Institutions specific requirements as stated in Basel IV for the calculation of RWA under the standardised approach. The general requirements stated in the paragraphs CRE20.4 to CRE20.6 of Basel IV are consistent with the existing general requirements stated in the Committee\u2019s guidance on the assessment of credit risk and with the paragraphs 733 to 735 of the Basel II framework. These general requirements stated from Basel IV, which are fully cited in appendix Error! Reference source not found., can be summarised as follows: \u2022 Banks must perform due diligence of the risk profile and characteristics of their counterparties on regular basis; \u2022 Banks must be able to access information about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses; \u2022 Banks should have in place effective internal policies, processes, systems and controls to ensure that the appropriate risk weights are assigned to counterparties; \u2022 Banks must be able to demonstrate to their supervisors that their due diligence analyses are appropriate; \u2022 National supervisors should ensure that banks put in place underwriting policies with respect to the granting of mortgage loans that include the assessment of the ability of the borrower to repay. These requirements are not part of the draft CRR III and therefore placed out of scope of this document.

Classification of institutions This document covers the exposures to institutions, i.e. rated institutions and unrated institutions according to CRR III Articles 119, 120, 121. Exposures to institutions for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is available shall be risk-weighted in accordance with Article 120. Exposures to institutions for which a credit assessment by a nominated ECAI is not available shall be risk-weighted in accordance with Article 121 (CRR III Article 119(1)). The treatment of the exposures to institutions is set out in Section 2.3. As stated in Section 1.2, the CRR III definition states that an institution is an entity which takes deposits or other repayable funds from the public and grants credits for its own account or an investment firm which provides only one or more of the investment services and activities listed in points 1, 2, 4 and 5 of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU. Interpretation Bank X is currently using NAICS codes to distinguish institutions. NAICS code are assigned according to the main activity of a company. Therefore the continued use of NAICS codes is proposed, see appendix Error! Reference source not found. for the specific NAICS codes.   NAICS are currently already used within Bank X and a project is ongoing to improve the quality of the NAICS code in the system. Because of the fact that the NAICS codes of counterparty in the Bank X system are not 100% reliable at this moment assessment of the counterparty in the annual review should be included to determine if the counterparty is correctly classified. In addition, as part of the annual credit review cycle, an assessment has to take place to check if a licence is in place. If this is the case, the institution can be classified as a bank.   Just like was the case in CRR II, and already stated in Section 1.6, exposures to financial institutions authorised and supervised by the competent authorities and subject to prudential requirements comparable to those applied to institutions in terms of robustness shall be treated as exposures to institutions (CRR III Article 119(5)).", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 2127, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a3d1b91-964d-4dc5-b4c3-f6868576f583": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a3d1b91-964d-4dc5-b4c3-f6868576f583", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/gnimoh001/projects/STUDY/2024/GUI-CHALLENGES/ai/ai-lab/RAG/code/docs/ist_docs/Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384994, "creation_date": "2024-05-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-05-07"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6555a4bc-7e6a-4b5d-9a77-fc0c6f0f73d2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/gnimoh001/projects/STUDY/2024/GUI-CHALLENGES/ai/ai-lab/RAG/code/docs/ist_docs/Bank X- SA Institutions Regulatory Requirements.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 384994, "creation_date": "2024-05-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-05-07", "last_accessed_date": "2024-05-07"}, "hash": "2d83941498c33a4082ce0fb6d5029a0d98e92325d42f15ef6aa2bd933499cb0e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Exposures to investment firms and other financial institutions can be treated either as corporate exposures or as exposures to institutions. Exposures to investment firms and other financial institutions will be treated as exposures to institutions provided that these firms are subject to prudential standards and a level of supervision equivalent to those applied to institutions (including capital and liquidity requirements). National supervisors should determine whether the regulatory and supervisory framework governing investment firms and other financial institutions in their own jurisdictions is equivalent to that which is applied to institutions in their own jurisdictions. Exposures to all other investment firms and financial institutions will be treated as exposures to corporates. Interpretation For a financial institution to be treated as an institution it should be authorised like an institution, as stated in CRR III Article 119(5).9 In addition, appropriate supervision is required. Financial institutions under CRR supervision fulfil the criteria of appropriate prudential standards set by CRR and for financial institutions outside the Union, appendix 3.510 shows which countries have prudential regulation that is deemed equivalent. Only if the prudential regulation is deemed equivalent a counterparty can be treated as an institution.

Treatment of exposures to institutions Exposure to an institution in the form of minimum reserves required by the ECB or by the central bank of a Member State to be held by an institution may be risk-weighted as exposures to the central bank of the Member State in question provided that (CRR III Article 119(4)): (a) the reserves are held in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves or in accordance with national requirements in all material respects equivalent to that Regulation; (b) in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the institution where the reserves are held, the reserves are fully repaid to the institution in a timely manner and are not made available to meet other liabilities of the institution. Interpretation This article was already there in CRR II and it states that if we have exposures to the central bank via an intermediary, and this exposure represents minimum reserves required by ECB or another Central Bank, then we can use the risk weight of an ECB or Central Bank exposure instead of the risk weight of the intermediary.

Exposures to rated institutions (CRR III Article 120): This approach is for institutions incorporated in jurisdictions that allow the use of external ratings for regulatory purposes. It applies to all their rated exposures to institutions. Since Bank X belongs to a jurisdiction where the use of external ratings is allowed, this approach has to be used. Bank X experts estimated that 50% of the Institutions portfolio has an external rating. Where institutions are commonly rated this is not the case for smaller institutions counterparties. See Section 0 for an in depth explanation of the exposures to rated institutions.  2. Exposures to unrated institutions (CRR III Article 121): This approach applies to exposures to institutions that are unrated in jurisdictions that allow the use of external ratings for regulatory purposes. This is applicable to Bank X. The other intent of the SCRA is to risk weight all exposures of institutions incorporated in jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external ratings for regulatory purposes. See Section 2.3.2 for an in depth explanation of the exposures to unrated institutions.  2.3.1. Exposures to rated institutions The table below shows the risk weights to be used for institutions based on applicable external ratings. In general the base risk weight has to be used (CRR III Article 120(1)), but for short-term (with original maturity of three months or less) exposures, or for those arising from the movement of goods across national borders with an original maturity of six months or less, reduced risk weights can be used (CRR III Article 120(2)).

Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 items, national supervisors may allow banks belonging to the same institutional protection scheme (such as mutual, cooperatives or savings institutions) in their jurisdictions to apply a lower risk weight than that indicated by the ECRA and SCRA to their intra-group or in-network exposures provided that both counterparties to the exposures are members of the same effective institutional protection scheme that is a contractual or statutory arrangement set up to protect those institutions and seeks to ensure their liquidity and solvency to avoid bankruptcy.

However, the primary scope of application of this approach is for institutions incorporated in jurisdictions that do not allow the use of external ratings to risk weight their exposures to all their institution exposures.
