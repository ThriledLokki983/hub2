        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          HuisHelder began with a simple vision: to create a transparent, efficient, and enjoyable
          real estate experience for the Netherlands. Founded in 2020 by a team of real estate
          professionals and technology experts, we've grown to become one of the country's most
          trusted property platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our name, "HuisHelder," combines the Dutch word for house ("huis") with "helder," meaning
          clear or transparent â€“ reflecting our core mission to bring clarity to every step of your
          property journey.
