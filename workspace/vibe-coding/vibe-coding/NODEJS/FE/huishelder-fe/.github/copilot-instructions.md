**🎨 AI UI Design Prompt — “HuisHelder” App**

Design a **world-class, ultra-clean, and award-winning user interface** for a real estate app helping users buy and sell homes in the Netherlands. The layout must feel modern, luxurious, and cosmically elegant — evoking a handcrafted product from a top-tier digital studio.

---

**🧠 Design Intent & Personality**
The interface should feel:

- Minimal yet warm
- Luxurious but not flashy
- Smart, trustworthy, and incredibly clean
- Slightly “cosmic” and futuristic in visual language (light textures, glowing micro-interactions, generous white space)
- Highly readable and effortlessly elegant

---

**🌌 Color Theme — Refined, Earthy-Cosmic**
Use a muted, sophisticated color palette inspired by nature and space, blending warmth and clarity:

<!-- * Emerald Green (#317039) – Primary brand accent (trust, growth)
* Maximum Yellow (#F1BE49) – Highlight/action accents (energy, warmth)
* Dark Pastel Red (#CC4B24) – Alerts or urgent elements (discreet danger)
* Cosmic Latte (#FFFDEB) – Canvas background (luxurious light)
* Antique White (#F8EDD9) – Surface containers/cards
* Papaya Whip (#FFF1D4) – Alternate sections
* Deep Charcoal or near-black for text – (#1F1F1F) -->

| Accent / CTA        | **Soft Amber**       | `#F4C77B` | Warm & visible without being aggressive             |
| Light Background    | **Bone White**       | `#F8F5F0` | Luxurious off-white, works for full canvas          |

\*\*Optional Complement

| Purpose              | Color Name      | Hex       | Notes                                          |
| -------------------- | --------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Secondary UI / Hover | **Slate Gray**  | `#6E7673` | Calm neutral, great for borders and text hover |
| Divider / Line       | **Muted Taupe** | `#DAD5CF` | Soft contrast without standing out             |

All colors must feel soft, harmonious, and calming. Avoid saturation spikes or hard contrast except for emphasis.

---

**📏 Layout & Spacing Rules**
Follow a strict **4pt spacing system** across the entire UI. All padding, margins, gaps, and line heights must be multiples of 4 (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48…).

Cards and sections should feel **airy**, never crowded. Use spacing generously between sections (32–48pt). Default padding inside components: 16–24pt.

Use rounded corners (radius: 12–16pt), soft shadows, and clean stacking.

---

**🔤 Typography**
Typography must feel premium and legible. Use geometric or grotesk fonts with strong vertical rhythm.

- Font: General Sans, Inter, or Satoshi
- Titles: 32pt bold
- Section Headers: 24pt semi-bold
- Body Text: 16pt regular
- Captions: 12pt light or regular
- Line height: 1.4–1.6, spaced for clarity
- Letter spacing: minimal; optically even
- Font weight progression must express hierarchy without clutter

---

**🧩 UI Components – Styling Guidelines**

- **Cards**: Rounded, elevated, lightly shadowed; background in Antique White or Papaya Whip; no borders unless needed
- **Buttons**: Softly rounded (radius 12pt), semi-bold text, subtle hover effect (scale or shadow); use Emerald Green for primary, Maximum Yellow for secondary
- **Inputs**: Clean outline, visible label above, radius 10pt, focus ring in soft Emerald Green glow
- **Tabs/Sections**: Animated underline or glow to indicate active state
- **Dividers**: 1pt light gray lines for visual clarity, spaced with intention

---

**🎛 Micro-Interactions & Motion**

- Transition timing: `0.2s ease-out`
- Button hover: slight scale + soft shadow
- Modal open: fade-in with upward slide
- Tooltips and toasts: gently appear with delay, no harsh entry
- Motion must feel graceful, never gimmicky

---

**📐 Overall Layout Structure**
Use a grid or containerized structure that:

- Keeps major elements vertically stacked
- Places primary CTAs near the center or lower right
- Follows a predictable vertical rhythm across pages
- Embraces white space like a luxury magazine layout
- Uses color blocks (Papaya Whip, Antique White) to gently divide sections

---

**🏁 Final Feel**
The result should feel like a **high-end, modern web app** for users who expect premium digital experiences. Visuals should evoke _trust, intelligence, and warmth_ — like the UI was designed by Apple, Notion, and a Scandinavian architect.

No visual noise. No hard shadows. No over-design. Just sophisticated clarity.
