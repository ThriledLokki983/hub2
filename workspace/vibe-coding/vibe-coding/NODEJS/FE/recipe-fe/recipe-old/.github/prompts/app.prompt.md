Design Brief: High-End Ghanaian Recipe App

Create an elegant, premium-quality recipe app celebrating Ghanaian cuisine. The
design should exude the finesse of an award-winning product—crafted with
precision, style, and cultural pride.

Visual Style & Aesthetic: • Design Quality: Think world-class design—ultra-clean
layout, refined details, and a modern, minimal approach. • Typography: Use
sophisticated, editorial-style typography. Fonts like Inter or Neue Haas Grotesk
are preferred. Apply thin font weights with -4 letter spacing for a sleek,
upscale feel. • Cultural Accent: Subtly incorporate Kente-inspired patterns or
visual cues to root the design in Ghanaian heritage—elegant, not overbearing.

Color Palette:

Use only the following colors to build a cohesive and luxurious aesthetic: •
Emerald Green #317039 (RGB: 49, 112, 57) • Maximum Yellow #F8E449 (RGB: 241,
190, 73) • Antique White #F8EDD9 (RGB: 248, 237, 217) • Dark Pastel Red #CC4B24
(RGB: 204, 75, 36) • Papaya Whip #FFFDD4 (RGB: 255, 253, 212) • Cosmic Latte
#FFF8EB (RGB: 255, 251, 235)

Additional guidelines: • Use clean white text where needed for clarity. •
Integrate cosmic, futuristic tones (like galaxy greys and muted oranges) without
introducing harsh contrasts. • Avoid the use of UI libraries or design
frameworks—build custom, handcrafted UI components to preserve a distinct and
tailored look.
